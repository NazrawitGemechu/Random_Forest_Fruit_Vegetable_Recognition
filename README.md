# Instructions for Running the Code

## Random Forest

To run the Random Forest implementation for the Fruit and Vegetable Recognition System, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**: You can use Google Colab Notebook since it has all the required libraries already installed.
2. **Load Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is provided in the reference section below.
3. **Load Model**: The model we trained for this projet is also on the link provided in the reference section below.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: You can evaluate the model using the test set in the dataset and also the sample attached images provided along with the code.
